  <h1 style="color: #000000;">About Me</h1>
  
  <p>I am a computer enthusiast, currently focused on upskilling in data structures and algorithms. I will start my MS in Computer Science in Spring 2025.</p>

  <p>My interest lies at the intersection of computer vision and NLP. I am particularly interested in exploring techniques to overcome current limitations and enhance the generalization capabilities of AI models, with applications in autonomous robotics and medical imaging.</p>
  <p>I previously worked at Orbbec R&D as a software engineer under the supervision of Dr. Nan Xu. At Orbbec, I focused on deploying image processing algorithms, testing and documenting the Orbbec SDK, and building computer vision and VR prototypes. I received my bachelor's degree from Mississippi State University, where I worked with Dr. Marojevic Vuk during my senior year on the AERPAW project as an undergraduate research assistant, focusing on SRS systems for 4G and 5G networks. My work involved using srsRAN and ZMQ to test, optimize, and enhance network performance.</p>
