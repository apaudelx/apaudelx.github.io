<h1>About Me</h1>

I am a computer enthusiast and am currently working on building my skills in data structures and algorithms.

Currently, my interest lies in the intersection of computer vision and NLP. Specifically, I am interested in developing robust multi-models, focusing on autonomous robots and medical imaging. I want to build models that can reason well enough to help the current use cases of AI in healthcare and robotics.

I previously worked at Orbbec R&D as a software engineer under the supervision of Dr. Nan Xu. At Orbbec, I focused on deploying image processing algorithms, testing and documenting the Orbbec SDK, and building computer vision and VR prototypes. I received my bachelor's degree from Mississippi State University, where I worked with Dr. Marojevic Vuk during my senior year on the AERPAW project as an undergraduate research assistant, focusing on SRS systems for 4G and 5G networks. My work involved using srsRAN and ZMQ to test, optimize, and enhance network performance.

I find collaboration to be key in any part of work and I always thrive in it. I get to learn and enjoy working together. If you have come this far, let's connect. I am open to collaboration on topics that align with my interests.
